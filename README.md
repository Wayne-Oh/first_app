# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is my exercise of the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

So far, other than 1 tiny snafu in chap 6, 
I have followed chapters 1-6 flawlessly.  
The tutorial works with Rails as expected.
Great job, Michael!
